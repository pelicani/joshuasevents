    <BIO><![CDATA[Steve Mumford lives and works in New York city. Perceiving the automobile as an American icon, Mumfordâ€™s grandiose paintings of automobiles display many of the ideas once associated with cars, such as freedom, modernity, and strength. Mumford also focuses in on design elements that compose the look of these automobiles. His replication of brand logos and the distinctive architecture of classic cars creates a relationship between his paintings and the ideas and energy we once associated with big, fast cars.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Vik Muniz is renowned for creating beguiling images using unusual materials. Muniz utilizes photography as a final document, as a means to translate the artistic process that went into creating the imagery that has been captured on film. He frequently references art history and cultural icons in his work, as well as his own personal experience. Whether Muniz is working with chocolate, thread, nails, or other materials, his art consistently operates on a level between drawing, photography, and sculpture.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Clusellasâ€™ abstract compositions often bound between deeply personal emotions and whimsical, pop culture imagery.  Mixing ephemeral media such as chalk with much more substantial oil paint allows for a blackboard effect.  This, along with the portrayal of trucks and cars are a refreshing dose of juvenile boyhood, evoking feelings of nostalgia and playfulness.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Brody\'s paintings explore perspective using a number of geometric sequences.  His images challenge viewers to figure out where the focus of the painting is.

The abstract works are inspired by such varying mathematical elements as musical arrangements and fractal geometry.  Brody explores the rhythms of sequences in an informal way.

Brody\'s work is an example of a human mind trying to comprehend, explore, and visualize theoretical and abstract processes.  His rendition of these thoughts is a geographical landscape filled with mysterious valleys and undetectable locii.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[One subject that has continued to fascinate Gout is the dashboard decoration craze amongst Mexico City bus drivers.  Drivers often take the personalizing of their vehicles - known popularly as \"Guajolojets\" - to new levels by festooning the area surroun-ding their seats with religious images, photographs of family members, toys, and other assorted objects.

Gout recreated his own version of this activity by acquiring a bus and decking out the driver\'s area with a number of absurd items.  He then hired a person to drive this vehicle around the city.  Ironically, the resulting photographs of  the driver and the front of the bus reveal a scene that could easily be mistakened as genuine.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lins\' sculptures are whimsical representations of prosaic, kitschy objects that have been skillfully carved out of foam rubber;   whitening as it ages. 

The objects are placed on pedestals that have been equipped with louvered vents on the sides.  This amusing addition not only draws attention to the lowly and undervalued pedestal, it also jokingly implies that a certain sense of sophistication is required to create one.

The works are a portrayal of the type of revered, non-art items that can be found in almost any home.  Lins usually depicts objects that are souvenirs of accomplishments, such as a trophy; or the spoils of a particularly good shopping excursion, such as a pair of boots.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lance Horenbein was born in 1969 in Petoskey, Michigan, and was raised in Tallahassee, Florida.  He now lives and works in New York City. Horenbein\'s series of photographs taken at across the country offer a fascinating insight into a diminishing aspect of American life.  Inspired by his surroundings, Horebein\'s camera effortlessly captures beauty where others  see decay and gaudiness. The inherent innocence in much of Horenbein\'s works remind viewers what it was like to once be in awe of the more tangible things in life.  Any naivete ends there, however, as evinced in Horenbein\'s sophisticated artistic eye and technique.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Many of Basora\'s works as an adult have reflected her early artistic training.  Her paintings are treated like shrines, and are filled with the type of spirituality that is bestowed upon representations of holy figures.  Her paintings of young girls and children often exlore how youngsters are treated and portrayed in current society.  With their fetishized clothing and sumptutous surroundings, Basora features them as recipients of decadence and awe.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Willard Boepple has exhibited widely since the mid-â€™70s. One of Americaâ€™s most respected sculptors, Boepple is known as an artistâ€™s artist. His wooden sculptures are primarily influenced by utilitarian sculptures that interact with humans, such as: ladders, shelves, and mechanisms with levers and cogs. It is not the objects themselves that are of interest, but their dimensions and proportions. His craftsmanship displays a modernist sense of connection with the long history of sculpture. His work can be found in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art New York, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, Storm King Art Center in New York, and Numerous other public and private collections around the world.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Much of Artschwager\'s deals with representations of natural versus synthetic materials and how they are manifested in our daily lives.  For example, instead of creating sculptures out of wood, he will use vinyl with wood grain printed on it;  or he will opt for formica instead of marble.  Artschwager combines these materials, intended to be imitations, with natural ones in his sculptures and paintings.  Many of his works reflect minimal Modernist design ideas from the mid-20th century, the age which introduced and celebrated items such as plastic, vinyl, and formica.  This was also the time in which Pop art flourished, and Artschwager\'s works more than a little of this sensibility.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[After studying art in Germany, Baechler returned to the United States just as Neo-Expressionist painting was staring to become popular.  Baechler began exhibiting in New York City in 1980 and became associated with this movement, along with others such as Keith Haring and Jean-Michel Basquiat.  Neo-Expressionistic works usually exhibit a use of exuberant colors and energetic, physical artistic processes.  Baechler\'s works also offer lots of Pop imagery with his implementation of commercial icons and symbols.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[From brushy, ecstatic free-form works to tightly rendered paintings with strictly delineated forms, Burke has experienced many of the faces that experimenting with painting has to offer.  Burke\'s paintings have been influenced by a variety of sources, including Japanese designs, Italian Renaissance frescoes, and paint-by-number kits.  Many of his works are based on topics such as virtues and seasons. The paintings are the result of a synthesis of relationships; where technique meets influence on equal ground. Combining both the pictorial and the purely abstract, Burke\'s body of work becomes a celebration of ideas and painting.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Breitz\'s two-part video installation Mother + Father (2005), is an enthralling work. In one room, six distressed mothers were seen on plasma screens; six troubled fathers were likewise shown in an adjacent room. The twist here is that all of these parents in extremes were culled from Hollywood blockbusters. Breitz took short clips, some a few seconds long and some just a split second, from several recognizable films dealing with parental mayhem, like Kramer vs. Kramer, Mommie Dearest, and Postcards From the Edge. Because of Breitz\'s expert editing and the fact that everything occurs against a neutral backdrop, iconic figures from the big screen seem to have been extracted from their original movies to be placed in some frantic, herky-jerky, endlessly shifting group discussion having to do with the upheavals and anxieties of parenthood.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Koester has traveled to remote or little-known communities to capture images on film.  One location he visited was Christiania, an anacrhistic commune located on a former military base in Denmark.  It was founded in the 1970s by people who were interested in develping their own social and economic structure.  Given the desig-nation of being a \"free city\" by the Danish government, Christiania continues to thrive.  His photographs of this location were taken using day-for-night film, producing a curiously unsettling effect.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Eric Rhein uses the precision of a jeweler to create delicate constructions from wire, paper, monofilament, and appropriated objects such as sentimental bits of jewelry, discarded rusty bottle caps, gears, and crystals. Drawing on his  Southern-gothic heritage of Appalachian Kentucky, Rhein explores the delicate and powerful connections among humans, nature, and the spiritual world where loss and rebirth connect the past with the future. His drawings and sculptures evoke a transcendent universe inhabited by leaves, birds, animals, and human figures that represent the metamorphosis of human relationships and experience.]]></BIO>

Using a surrealistic approach to making his work, Woods wrap objects such as branches, floors, and television sets with paper that has been printed with glossy text or patterns that clearly indicate what lies beneath the layers of paper. By assigning these objects with a new grain design of his own make, the lose their original organic surface and gain a new, simulation of one drawn by the artist. Some of the objects that Richard Woods have wrapped include tree branches, computer monitors, floorboards, and even a small Tudor home.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Built from rows of stacked cotton and wooden boxes, covered with found objects, and caked with rust to suggest decay, Drew\'s large wall reliefs function as social statements and as meditations on creation and process. To date, widely held interpretations of Drew\'s work center on the artist\'s African-American identity. His use of such evocative materials as bales of raw cotton, rope, and canvas bags like those of cotton pickers evoke black life under slavery; rusted debris found on city streets connotes urban degeneration.  - Martin Puryear]]></BIO>

Something more than a jokey greeting card?]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lucas Reinerâ€™s abstract paintings and drawings find their inspiration in daily moods, happenstance, and everyday experience. His works, which are as likely to be composed of oil paint as they are of dirt, often make references to humor, pop culture, and nostalgia. Reiner celebrates the exercise of creating artwork with visual statements that serve as a commentary on the chaotic collision of colors and brushstrokes taking place on his canvases.]]></BIO>

Using enamels and old-fashioned painting techniques, the artist is able to present the image of words and organic-looking forms trapped within the depths of the artwork.  Mixing these cartoonish forms with the words, Gillmore displays what appears to be a stomach tract in the process of  \"digesting\" bits of text.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The astonishing thing about Robert Heckes\'s weird and effective \"paintings\" is that they contain no paint at all. Instead they\'re made of vast numbers of playing cards (the colored sides replete with pictures, diagrams and advertisements), which are glued to the underlying canvas whole or cut into little strips. It\'s amazing what Heckes is able to accomplish in terms of visual richness and complexity with this material: composing complicated scenes and intricate patterns pushing the often vibrant colors of the cards for all they\'re worth, pursuing art-historical and cultural references.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[His sculpture, allied with the minimalist school of the late 1960s, has the appearance of industrial fabrication. He used rectangular forms fashioned from painted wood, polychrome, or steel in equally spaced, repeated units. The artist eschewed any relationship to the larger world in his works, preferring to leave them untitled. Examples of his work are in the Whitney Museum, New York City and many other public institutions. In the 1970s, Judd acquired a number of massive buildings and tracts of land in Marfa, Tex., where he established the Chinati Foundation, which exhibits his own works and those of other minimalists, as well as related art.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Annette Lemieux was born in Norfolk, Virginia in 1957.  She now lives and works in Boston, Massachussetts.
 Lemieux is a conceptual artist who is quite comfortable working in a variety of media.  Photographs, sculptural assemblages, and painted works have all appeard in her exhibitions.  Many of her jokes revolve around a quiet, simple kind of humor.  Her work, â€œComing and Goingâ€, features two photographs taken from the rear of two different taxi cabs as the artist takes a trip to and from an undisclosed destination.  Little hints, such as that the driver is on the right hand side of the vehicle clues the viewer that these scenes occured in a foreign country, such as the U.K.  Lemieux has shown her work in galleries and museums around the world.  Annette is also a professor of visual arts at Harvard University.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In all of the works, there is an undercurrent of analysis of the human condition, much of it represented in the form of roughly-carved wood and terracotta sculptures.  This social element owes much to Lerman\'s art studies in Soviet Russia, where strict rules were enforced and artwork reflecting emotional, nationalistic fervor was encouraged.

In one of his most recent series, Lerman re-created a scene from the story of the Trojan war.  Placing sculptures of dead soldiers on the floor, he encircled this tableaux with a ring of wood-carved ravens.  Lerman\'s expressionistic bird sculpure imply both a sense of both loss and irony.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[An Iranian-born artist who has lived in the United States since 1974, Shirin Neshat portrays intensely emotional  in her photographs and films.  Neshat questions the role of women in Islamic society, exploring the tension between collective cultural identity and individual freedoms. Neshat often uses the chador, the head-to-toe Islamic covering that is mandatory for women in Iran, as an paradoxical icon for repression and female identity.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Pigeons, UPS drivers, Ford models, the moon, dead sharks, pine trees, over-saturated Harry & David catalog pages, interstate highway junctions, idyllic rural landscapes, and basement clutter. Roe Ethridge shifts between photographic subjects, swiftly discarding them for inverse yet connected subjects. Subjects are set aside, only to be revisited and intermixed with the others.   \"It\'s the same image whether it\'s illustrating a text or has a caption, on the walls or on a bus stop. I like the fact that photography is ubiquitous and polymorphic, that it can be for the specialist or the dilettante or sometimes both at the same time.\"  Roe Ethridge was born in 1969 in Miami and received a BFA in Photography at The College of Art in Atlanta, GA. He has exhibited in museums and galleries in the U.S. and Europe, including the ICA, Boston; P.S.1, New York; Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh, and the Barbican Gallery, London.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Neil Farber lives and works in Winnipeg, Canada. He is the uncle of fellow Royal Art Lodge artist Marcel Dzama. The imaginative pieces frequently illustrate the world of a character that Farber calls â€œPoppoâ€. In particular, they follow the artistâ€™s journey through a Dante-esque universe with Poppo serving as guide after the manner of Virgil. Farberâ€™s works tend to evoke a sense of pity while examining feelings of isolation and loneliness through the scope of his humorous drawings.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Ian Dawson\'s plastic sculptures -- usually comprised of cheap, brightly colored plastic furniture and storage containers melted into bizarre, evocative shapes -- are peerless examples of a type of abstract art that abandons all received notions of form, content, and context. And while the original plastic objects have been transformed so completely as to be ultimately unrecognizable, the resulting artwork always bears the evidence of Dawson\'s extremely energetic and highly physical aesthetic process. The artist\'s wild conglomerations -- brilliant, melted mountains of color -- possess and impart a pure visual power not unlike the work of earlier Abstract Expressionist painters like Jackson Pollock and mark Rothko. Dawson\'s deft handling of his blowtorch -- picture a radically updated sculptor\'s hammer and chisel -- produces graceful protrusions, frozen swirls, and tightly controlled chaos, allowing the artist to instill the synthetic material with incongruously biomorphic forms and the suggestion of organic activity.]]></BIO>

Shoddy workmanship, common detritus, haphazard construction materials, and lonely, weird and misplaced photographs comprised Harrisonâ€™s representational rubric of todayâ€™s experimental and disposable culture. Harrison wants you to look very closely at the meaning of want, and what it feels like to have what you once wanted]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Bill Albertini lives and works in New York City.  With the help of sophisticated computer software, Albertini creates photographs and video art pieces that feature space-age interiors.  
     The photographs usually function as film stills of his video works.  Although they conceptually intend to serve as representational photographs, they are in fact images of digitally rendered spaces.
     The rooms that appear in his \"Whiteroom\" series are made to look as if they are brightly lit and constructed of gleaming materials.  In the center of the space, there is a sculptural, amorphous form that has a new shape in each photograph.
     Bill Albertini\'s imaginary architectural area serves as a gallery of sorts for the red, abstract sculpture within it.  His photographs also have cinematic aspects to it, especially when one considers  how they relate to their source video pieces.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Neutralizing and homogenizing his subjects, the characters that figure in his works have the generic, vaguely familiar appearance similar to the illustrations of children used to market commercial food and product lines.

Mellyn\'s paintings also have references to science;  specifically genetics and hybridization.  Many of his works, such as Big Girl, depict imposing uber-children who appear to be the product of generations of specialized breeding of only the healthiest and largest adults.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Nina Bovasso produces works on paper and pantings which are comprised of compartmentalized motifs within precarious structures. Using mixed acrylic media, Bovasso creates simple dots, lines, and geometric shapes, as well as more complex symbolic forms like flattened hearts, flowers, and letters of the alphabet. In some works, Bovassoâ€™s motifs manifest themselves as complicated worlds of minutiae which cluster and disperse. In others, motifs are magnified in difference spatial configurations. Bovassoâ€™s work explores the issue of surface as phenomenon. Unlike the flat, homogeneity of the digitally produced imagery which pervades contemporary visual culture, the drawings possess a depth, texture, and materiality which ground them in the real.]]></BIO>

Conceptual in though, the works do not always focus on the canals themselves, but also on what a viewer would see if one were able to journey alongside the waterways.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Darkness and light. Blindness and insight. Nature and Science. 
These dichotomies arise in Finchâ€™s work only to have their usefulness and validity interrogated. Their too-easy formulas and their promise of an absolute veracity are not to be trusted. His work for the past decade had consciously distilled these issues and has grown richer, more potent. Resisting conclusion, Finch nevertheless aspires to a greater appreciation of the problem.  - Charles LaBelle, Frieze.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Kim Keever was born in New York City, where he continues to reside and work. After many years of making paintings, Keever decided to switch to photography after seeing the work of well known artist Cindy Sherman, who is renowned for her photographs of staged scenarios. Keever was also inspired by the work of 19th century American landscape painters from the Hudson River School. This influence is clearly evidence in his creations of miniature, yet grandiose, scenes of natural landscape models in a 100 gallon fish tank in his apartment.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lois Renner is another West Collection artist who is a model-maker photographing his models. Like Didier Massard and Kim Keever, Renner creates a trickey space designed to play with the viewerâ€™s perceptions. Unlike Massard and Keever, who are very interested in creating super-romanticized worlds, Renner delights in creating familiar realistic messy environments . Renner drops rather large, but somehow hidden, clues to the scale of the models confusing many viewers. Is that a real lighter, or an oversized toy?]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lawler examines the methods of presentation and display for artwork in both commercial and private spaces.  Her work invariably tracks how a stationary object such as an artwork develops its own form of movement, as it changes hands from artist, to gallerist, to collector - and later, the auction block, etc.

She also looks at how different people or institutions exhibit their work in relation to other objects.  For example, an auction house might stack valuable works one on top of the other in a rather indifferent manner;  while a collector might carefully choose the best wall of their home to hang a treasured painting.]]></BIO>

The artist became adept at utilizing complicated software such as Form Z and Lightscape, which are the same types of tools used by designers who work on special effects for movies such as Star Wars.  Kalpakjian\'s images are simulations of the architecture of industrial offices, whose environments are perceived as places  where sterility and anonymity prevail.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Bolande\'s works focus on iconographic images of contemporary culture and the way the individual relates to them.  Her work Road Movie;  composed of six discrete photographs, uses trucks and roads as symbols of freedom, move-ment, and transportation.  Bolande also examines these vehicles in relation to the human form.  Her photo-graphs match the design of items such as toy trucks and driving components to parts of her own body.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Petah Coyne was born in 1953 in Oklahoma City.  She is a longtime resident of New York City.  Much of Petah\'s work deals with spirituality and mysticism.  Coyne admits to being strongly influenced by her strict Irish-Catholic upbringing.   Her photographs in particular seem to study the fleeting nature of time and human lives.  Coyne\'s work experiments with materials and unorthodox practices.  Her work has appeared in numerous galleries and exhibitions around the world.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[A photographer with more than twenty years of experience under his belt, Mitch Epstein\'s works are best described as being about seizing the moment.  Epstein\'s scenes are pastoral and poetic, reflecting his surroundings in a muted way.  His snapshots offer glimpses of daily life that might otherwise go unnoticed or forgotten:  the line that a sportcoat made while lying on the grass in Central Park, or the sharp diagonal division created by an escalator against a bold red wall.  From within the scope of Epstein\'s camera lens not only are human personalities being  revealed, but landscapes that no one knew existed before are unearthed.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Todd Hido was born in 1968 in Kent, Ohio. He currently resides and works in San Francisco. Hidoâ€™s photographs are inspired not only by his suburban upbringing in the midwest, but also by the idealistic housing developments dotted all over california in towns with names like Pacifica, Hayward, and Chula Vista. Because Hido uses only the available natural light, his photos need long exposure times in order to capture an image on film. He normally works during the evening, so the occupants of the building have no idea that their house are being photographed.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In installations, photographs, film, and community-based projects, Jaar explores the publicâ€™s desensitization to images and the limitations of art to represent events such as genocides, epidemics, and famines. Jaarâ€™s work bears witness to military conflicts, political corruption, and imbalances of power between industrialized and developing nations. Subjects addressed in his work include the holocaust in Rwanda, gold mining in Brazil, toxic pollution in Nigeria, and issues related to the border between Mexico and the United States.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Kalka is able to create the illusion of a wintry environment by allowing for a build-up of condensation within the piece.  The amount of moisture within the boxes depends entirely upon the humidity of the exterior environment.

The mist that lines the clear sides of the Plexiglas is reminiscent of a fogged up windshield in a car.  The components of the piece The Next Thing To Know, such as the trees and airplane, are also made of clear plastic which enhances the frosty aesthetic of the work.

Other works of Kalka\'s involve the use of a white, fluffy mold that he grows on the surfaces of the encased objects.  Before sealing up the Plexiglas cases, he will lightly dust the figurines inside with flour.  The condensation within the boxes will encourage the growth of mold, the resulting in the appearance of a snowy surface.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œMy videos and photographs examine paper as both a physical object and as a malleable document of the real. The imagery often relies on theatrical manipulation or illusion, but uses these mechanisms in order to inform or expand the meaning or reading of the imagery, rather than trick the viewer. My recent work employs video animation and photographic \'re-constructions\' that exploit the theatricality of architecture and landscape as a platform to spotlight the iconic and political structures of sports stadia.â€ - Rob Carter]]></BIO>

Howey\'s abstract shapes appear to serve in a capacity similar to hieroglyphic sympbols.  The artist\'s use of shapes and colors as a means of conveying  moods and feelings perform in a manner similar to the way a code or language would.  The distinctly modern look of Nick Howey\'s paintings is defined with the bold color palette he employs and the studied, carefully plotted geometrical designs depicted on his canvases.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Robert Lazzarini is an American sculptor whose works merge extreme realism with extreme distortion. Lazzarini recreates familiar objects to scale out of their original materials, while deforming them in seemingly implausible ways. He employs technologies I digital rendering and 3-D scans to remake the original object in distorted proportions. The physical, psychological, and emotional implications of this distortion yield works that are both amazing and unsetting]]></BIO>

He occasionally blends in other materials, such as paper and plastic, into the paintings.  The paintings are comprised of layer upon layer of paint.  Each labyrinthine stripe gives way to even smaller splotched and circles, allowing viewers to truly get lost in the artworks.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Roger S. Campbell currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York.  The artist is known for collecting discarded matresses and creating portraits of them.  He titles the works according to their brand names, which  tend to have an overly-dramatic, humorous appeal to them.  Campbell has also been know to use the mattresses themsleves as canvases for his paintings.  Campbell\'s illustrations of these throwaway objects  form a personal, curious bond between him and other people\'s intimate property. His decision to paint mattresses elevates their status, by treating them as subjects worthy of portraiture.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Many of Brooklyn artist Roxy Paine\'s best known sculptural works involve exceedingly accurate replicas of different types of mushrooms and toadstools (most of which are of the hallucinatory or poisonous variety). The amount of intensive labor and painstakingly rendered detail that is evident in the fabrication of these works is almost as astounding as the effect of a field of fungi seemingly erupting fro the floor or wall. Roxy is also known for his \"art-making machines\", such as his painting Manufacturing Unit, a mechanism he invented that creates paintings by repeatedly dunking canvases into a vat of paint.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"Fullerâ€™s art does not end with nostalgia. He switches the names of famous celebrities around so we are left with â€œPamela Anderson Leeâ€, â€œNicolette Stimpsonâ€, and â€œConnie Carsonâ€, (the young career woman making a career out of talking to women about women). You get the sense that Fuller grew up as engulfed in TV culture as the rest of us, though he clearly is not lacking in intelligence. The autistic artist taught himself to read at three, to type at six, and his works are filled with humorous subtleties, obviously the demise of an inventive wit. This TV junkie has a whole lot to say. . .\" from Zingmagazine Issue 17 review by Tracy Chabal]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Frampton constructs three-dimensional collages out of paper, paint, glue, and clay.  He also implements cut-outs from photographs that he has taken, and sets them up in much the same way paper dolls are.  The end result is a highly colorful diorama with a dramatic effect similar to that of a stage production.

Most of the tableaux depict urban scenes.  Although he normally works with models in his studio, Frampton has at times resorted 
to using a camera with a telephoto lens to capture candid photographs of random people standing on the sidewalk.  These people are then implemented into his set-ups, adding a realistic quality to the miniature scenes.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[was born in 1965 in Zurich, Switzerland; he currently lives and works in Brooklyn, New York. Primarily dealing with both natural and man-made disasters Draeger has created works that are based on historical events, but the majority of his photographs depict apocalyptic scenes that the artist has created in his studio. Using miniature pieces from railroad sets, toy cars, dirt, and other elements, Draeger constructs vast model landscapes. There are almost no clues within the piece that would give away the true scale of the scene.These tableaux of simulated wreckage turn the current media cultureâ€™s obsession with disasters and wreckage into a kitch-type product by having the photographs ink-jet printed on giant sheets of PVC, in the same manner advertising banners are. The work Catastrophe #1 and Catastrophe #2 were recently loaded to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art for an exhibition titled Game Show.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Known for his original extensive vocabulary of graphic drawings which use the visual language of public signage, corporate logos, and contemporary iconography, McGinness creates paintings, sculptures, and environments. Concerned with the perceived value of forms, McGinness is interested in assuming the power of this anonymous aesthetic in order to share personal expressions.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[While many of her works explore the private, intimate areas associated with one\'s home, she has also taken a number of nostalgic photos of old  furniture from the New York City public school system.  Each object  relays a personal history in her signtaure muted manner.  Carvings on desktops become evidence of generations of children, and lines on notebook pages patiently lie open and blank, the margins serving as a silent indicator as to whether they are used by English or Hebrew speakers.  Even with the most anonymous and common of objects, the extreme closeness of Raff\'s eye implies a warm, familiar relationship.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Woodworker-turned-artist francis Cape\'s sculpture is both banal, yet expertly conceptual.  Cape culled the forms themselves from a number of historical decorative-arts sources (Shaker-like recessed panels, Colonial style moldings, etc.)  In a sense, they\'re faithful restorations of objects that were never made.  - Time Out New York]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[French artist, Didier Massard has over twenty years of experience as an editorial and fashion photographer for such names as Hermes and Cacharet. Massardâ€™s artistic endeavors depict meticulously detailed miniature landscapes constructed on top of a table in his studio. His images strive to portray the voyages the mind undertakes while hearing stories or reading novels or fairy tales. Massardâ€™s skill as a master craftsman and fabricator of imaginary subjects is easily appreciated and enjoyed, as the work truly has the ability to transport viewers to these fictitious landscapes.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Many of Lipski\'s sculptures are considered to be referential to ideas and works from the Surrealist movement of the earlier half of the 20th century.  His work Exquisite Copse No. 6 cattily refers to a game popular amongst Surrealist and Dada artists in particular during the 1920s and 1930s, in which different people would collaborate to make one cohesive artwork.  In Lipski\'s piece, disparate materials are combined to make one beguiling sculpture.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Cornford & Cross are a British collaborative team currently living and working in London. Matthew Cornford and David Cross engage in a conceptual practice which has many formal permutations. The location of a project, social situation, and historical moment inform their practice. Weâ€™ve collected their large installation called 10, a technological social-Darwinist exploration of ideal beauty. For this project, Cornford & Cross worked with an economically-challenged area of England and conducted a â€œbeautyâ€ contest, whereby the top ten most symmetrical faces would be judged by a software program. The purpose of which is to question the importance of beauty to economic advantage, and how this kind of judging might be occurring outside of this project in every day Life.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Jonathan Callan was born in 1961. A sculptor by training, Callan has always been interested in work that references the physicality of objects. â€œIâ€™m self-consciously treating almost every book as an object first and foremost... I almost donâ€™t care what the book is about. Itâ€™s almost as if Iâ€™m interested in doing something to the book as an object to emphasize the fact that language is incapable of dealing with certain aspects of life.â€ In wonderland , Callan has created a series of childrenâ€™s toys injected with silicon. In using toys such as Tigger and Winnie the Pooh, which are loaded with cultural and historical content, Callan disrupts our sense of how things should be. As one saddened child visiting SEI commented, â€œThey never had a chance!â€ By altering these objects, Callan is not only deconstructing them physically, but questioning our hardened preconceptions that we will only truly understand such objects if we grasp their historical and cultural content.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Rob de Mar presents miniature landscapes which combine sociological observation and an homage to natural phenomena with personal narrative. Working in an array of synthetic and natural materials; including forged steel, plywood, flocking, fungi, stones, and model trees, de Mar creates tiny microcosms which sprout from the floor, walls, and corners. De Marâ€™s isolated sculptural universes radiate a tension between utopian and dystopian vision. Parking lots and macadam two-lane highways swerve through the mountains, trees and clouds. Is the and expansionist developerâ€™s dream or a preservationistâ€™s nightmare?]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Warren Isensee lives and works in New York City.  A true child of the atomic age, Isensee once worked at a nuclear power plant creating illustrations for emergency procedure manuals and signs.  One of the other major influences upon his work are cartoons and comic strips.  Isenseeâ€™s paintings are evocative of actions and scenes without the use of words of characters.  The technique exercised upon the canvas are also very reminiscent of printed or graphic works in that very little evidence of the paintbrush or human touch is visible.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Coke Oâ€™Neal finds his way into the bathrooms of relatives, friends, even sometimes strangers, and snaps pictures of the hidden mecca behind their mirrors. Only making sure that the names are concealed, O\'Neal voyeuristically examines the truth contained on the small shelves of medicine cabinets. His work thrives on an inquisitive arrogance, and pure curiosity.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Daniella Rossell captures the totally decadent wealth of the Mexican aristocracy in her series Ricas y Famosas. These photos depict a minority of ultra-rich Mexican women in their domestic spaces - some would say their â€œgolden cagesâ€. Most Documentary photography considering Mexican social systems concentrates on the largest and poorest segment of the population. Rossellâ€™s participants initially agreed to be photographed for this project. After the photos garnered critical press, many participants requested to pull out of the project.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Ellen Harvey was born in 1967 in Kent, England. â€œMost of my recent work is premised on the idea that the genres of painting (especially the more ludicrously dated ones, such as the romantic self-portrait, the idyllic landscape, the history painting) can proved fascinating and often extremely funny insight into societal expectations of the â€œproperâ€ functions of art. Consequently many projects consist of trying to disrupt particular genres, often through the use of other â€œnostalgicâ€ technologies of representation such as the polaroid or identity car -- a task quite properly doomed to failure.â€ In this series Harvey paints polaroids of women who were asked to make a monster face.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The series \"examples for communication\" uses photomaterial taken out of cheaply produced travel agency brochures.  In these brochures the pictures are used to transport the idea of a happy family vacation.

With a simple computer-aided interference their original intention is turned into its opposite. After removing all additional objects (magazines, toys, drinks etc.) which the models originally were given to make them look contented, the view is drawn on the relations between the acting people.  The apparent attracting, positive and enviable situation of succeeded communication changes into a state of miscommunication.]]></BIO>

The photographs are dynamic and contain no indicators of the real scale of the models.  to an unsuspecting viewer, they can truly appear to be images taken straight from an amateur filmmakerâ€™s movement that one would imagine would exist in the situations he depicts.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Boyce\'s work is heavily interested in the work of mid-20th century artists, especially those who created Minimalist work, such as Donald Judd.  He is also influenced by Modernist design, in particular the work of Ray and Charles Eames, whose simple, elegant objects, were produced with a positive, utopian vision for American society.  Boyce was fascinated by the notions of a country where regular household items were once designed and marketed for everyone to use.  He began creating his own works with these design ideas in mind.  By not creating obviously functional works such as chairs or tables, Boyce is able to keep his conceptual pieces within the realm of art and not simply design objects.  His works - part sculpture, part painting, part furniture - remain abstract, fanciful, and refreshingly free of categorization.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Lambie transforms ordinary objectsâ€”vinyl tape, turntables, speakers, doors, mirrors, clothing, chairsâ€”that he finds on the street or buys in secondhand and hardware stores into vibrant sculptures and site-specific installations. Lambie champions sensory pleasure over intellectual response, approaching his work with a simplicity and straightforwardness of form and material. \"I\'m not an information artist, I\'m not like a schoolteacher, I\'m just working with materials,\" says Lambie, who experiments with space and form in a way that breaks with traditional notions of elegance, deploying humble materials to create objects and installations that challenge the high-tech, high-brow aesthetics common to much of contemporary art and design. - Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]></BIO>

She says, â€œI believe in making work that privileges the material, formal and visual aspects of art making, and at the same time, articulates a specific concept or idea. I choose a medium as an extension of the concept. If painting my idea proves to be the best way to interpret that idea, then i use painting. If it reveals itself to be a video, then i use video. I see art as a process of discovery and intelligence-gathering. Sometimes, I may explore on idea in various media simultaneously, in order to gain a better understanding of it, or to understand what it is that i find resonant. Making art becomes a kind of multidimensional way of achieving comprehension.â€]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Oliver Boberg constructs small models of innocuous architectural sites, complete with such details as entrances, stairways, and gray concrete walls. The photographs that Boberg takes of the scenes all contain the capacity to appeal to a viewer in a vaguely familiar way. Their sense of the generic enables them to find a space in the memory of almost anyone who has ever been in an urban environment. The fictitious landscapes typically show these structures in the early stages of decay. Cement surfaces appear weathered or cracked, and parking lots look slightly old and unkept. Boberg\'s artworks study the undelivered promises of modernist architecture in Western cities, and how the neglect of these spaces has resulted in an overall dreary and un-humanized appearance. Despite the long hours that can go into laboring on them, Boberg always destroys the models after taking his photographs.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Hluchan has developed an entire body of work known as the \"Red Rabbit\" series.  Using a pictorial style similar to that used to illustrate children\'s story books or morality tales, Hluchan details the experiences of a toy rabbit and his friends.  Many of the scenes are humorous or ironic in nature.  They often show displays of the futile or silly things that occur in our lives.  Hluchan often mixes stereotypically fairy tale, Bavarian forest-style backdrops with more modern ones showing urban scenes with buildings, cars, and fire hydrants.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The artist first creates a scene out of everyday items, presenting an illusion out of the mundane.  Requiring more than just a surface viewing of them, they reveal more than a little bit of imagination and sense of craft.  For example, an image showing a treasure chest cleverly constructed out of peanut butter and crackers displays more than just artistic skill, but also a touch of irony.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Ken Weaver lives and works in New York. Weaver paints the dramatic, but largely unseen, citizens populating the rural and suburban underbelly of the United States. Through drawing, painting, installations, and video, we find dimwitted rednecks, spaced-out stoners, and kick-ass rock nâ€™ rollers with bad teeth, bad language, and bad attitudes and as aggressive as they are vulnerable. Ken Weaver spent his early career creating theater and performance art. He now uses this experience in his 2-D works by staging friends and actors to recreate the characters from his rural/suburban past. It is the artistâ€™s belief that through artifice, one can playfully gain an insight into the people we really are behind the mask of respectability, professionalism, and presentation.]]></BIO>

Among his major projects is Bensin, an encyclopedic documentation of the all-important gasoline store, and connection to the outer world for remote Icelanders. Additionally, Spessi has recorded out-of-the-way vacation spots, campsites and portraits of Icelanders. His lush prints are startlingly vivid, and their large scale makes them remarkably painterly.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Long-Bin Chen is known for using books, newspapers, magazines, and other material that has been discarded as the medium for creating his sculptures. This act of recycling paper-based material informs Chenâ€™s work; and the figures he creates are of an odd and extraordinary beauty. Buddha faces, Aztec and Chinese warriors, the human figure, land maps, and entire rooms are magically created out of discards from our â€œpaper societyâ€. The artist was born in Taiwan where he presently resides, after having lived and studied in New York in the 90s. The theme of converging Chinese and American cultures is central to his work, as is the notion of consumerism that is widely exhibited in germany, Japan, and Hong Kong, as well as the United States and Taiwan.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"At the expense of my own comfort, my work provides consolation to its viewers. I define, reconcile with, and exploit the misfortune andredundancy inherent in everyday life.There are an inordinate number of pictures that materialize in my mind day after day, some of which are too intangible to make concrete with line and color. Because of this, I view life as an oil slick. It gleams, stains, and threatens, while sheathed in graceful, fluid movement. Here dwells my compulsion.

    <BIO><![CDATA[HoustonÂ¹s style of punk surrealism revolves around a steadily growing stable of images that tread the line between abstract and representational. Inanimate products of industry, twisted science and fantasy are brought to life and collide on vinyl scrolls, aluminum panels, ink drawings, woodcuts and silk-screen prints. These narratives are often presented in glossy, highly charged color schemes, and reflect HoustonÂ¹s fascination with the tactile, absurd, and shiny. -- COlab Projects]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Rob Conger currently lives and works in New York City. Conger\'s long-time medium of choice has been the latch hook rug, a material long associated with craft stores and homemakers.  With his rugs he explores images related to money and our society\'s obsession with it attaining wealth;  usually in a humorous, witty fashion. He approaches this topic from a distinctly humble stance, using simple, inexpensive materials such as the yarn and canvas necessary needed to compose his artwork.   The technique used by Conger to create images on his rugs is reminiscent of the works of Impressionist artist such as Edouard Manet and Claude Monet, who utilized spontaneous applications of color and a lack of formal, strict lines to compose artwork filled with a sense of naturalism and light. The nostalgic aspect of the latch-hook rug has also proven ideal for capturing the fuzzy essence of familiar images culled from memory.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Erwin Wurm is one of Austriaâ€™s preeminent international contemporary artists. He has devoted his professional career to reshaping our concept of what constitutes a sculpture. In his One Minute Sculptures, Wurm invites the spectator to act like a sculpture using the props and materials he provides for the while he photographs or videos these events. The corporeal aspect of these pieces support his later voluminous and significant works, the Fat Cars. The Fat Cars are flesh-like vehicle in shades of brown, cream, pink and peach.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Working initially as a painter, Stipl has recently turned to making sculpture. Using himself as a model, Richard focuses exhaustively on the indefinite nature and moment-to-moment paradoxes inherent in the act of continuously recreating oneself throughout the course of a lifetime. Characteristically, Stiplâ€™s paintings and sculptural works alike force us to reconsider the role of boundaries and consequent categories of choice that comprise contemporary attitudes and approaches to art-making and art-consumption.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The iconography of full moons, reflecting pools, garden statuary, songbirds, butterflies and flowers has long been associated with notions of nostalgia and sentimentality.  I draw on inspirations ranging from Russian childrenâ€™s books to Victorian illustrations, from Japanese prints to Dutch botanical paintings in an effort to explore the sentimental image as a vehicle for personal expression.  I engage the bittersweet, the quaint, the melancholy and the picturesque to depict a world of glorious decay.  -Mixed Greens Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[She calls her sugar-created works \"subtleties,\"  
after the term used to describe 15th-century edible 
confectionery displays that were used to decorate 
royal banquets. 

Instead of choosing to fashion items such as flowers 
and butterflies out of the sugar, she instead focuses 
on items that remind her of her of the Midwestern 
culture she was born and raised in. 

The delicacy of the medium belies the deadly 
nature associated with the pistols and rifles she 
depicts in her works.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The imagery in my paintings is based on photographs that I take of family and friends, disparate objects, and patterns from fabrics that I like. Though the work is a documentation of my personal experiences, I hope that the images will evoke familiar feelings in anyone who gazes at them, and that viewers can relate to them as if they were stills from their own lives. The content and formal elements in my paintings combine to offer an always personal, occasionally caricature-like narrative addressing and encompassing both the awkwardness and the complexity of the human condition.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In a culture hyper-saturated by electronic imagery I use the traditional materials of a quill pen and a bottle of ink to create large-scale images that persist in exploring and claiming the sub-technological process of observation and mark-making.  My recent work consists of life size representation of figures and objects. There is an unusually vital relationship that arises between the observer and the observed on a scale of one to one.  The sleight, or sloppiness, of hand creates an awkward intimacy that is compounded by the definitive and energized process of cross hatching. -Joan Linder]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Sato exposes the film in the camera to light over a long duration.  While the camera is in this mode, Sato tranverses the space being photographed with a small flashlight and mirror.  Because of the slow exposure and his quicker movements, he himself does not appear on the film. Using the mirror to direct the thin streams of light, the artist highlights specific elements of a space\'s architecture.  The process  illustrates the invisible element of space using illumination as a type of drawing tool.  The result is a construction of light, captured on film with a camera.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Long-Bin Chen is known for using books, newspapers, magazines, and other material that has been discarded as the medium for creating his sculptures. This act of recycling paper-based material informs Chen\'s work; and the figures he creates are of an odd and extraordinary beauty. Buddha faces, Aztec and Chinese warriors, the human figure, land maps, and entire rooms are magically created out of discards from our â€œpaper societyâ€. The artist was born in Taiwan where he presently resides, after having lived and studied in New York in the 90s. The theme of converging Chinese and American cultures is central to his work, as is the notion of consumerism that is widely exhibited in germany, Japan, and Hong Kong, as well as the United States and Taiwan.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Two characteristics appear to remain significant throughout Melee\'s varied body of work.  One is his sense of camp, which is evident in his choices of color scheme and subject matter.  The other is his determination to elevate objects seen as common or low to the higher plane of fine art.

For the piece Semi-Articulated Chic Substitution, Melee collected and arranged a number of bottle caps on a canvas, in effect producing geometrically abstract mixed media painting.  The seemingly throwaway origins of the medium are forgotten when one views the work.

In the work Untitled Curtain I, a daily household object is preserved in plastic emulsion and plaster, then painted in bright stripes.  Melee explores new dimensions and formats for creating experiments with color and form, in a manner that is not dissimilar to the works by Color Field artists such as Mark Rothko.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[A friend of Svenson\'s, Ron Warren, began collecting the sock monkeys in 1985.  Since then, he has amassed thousands of the toys, a symbol of homespun inventiveness and thrift.  Svenson uses traditional portraiture techniques in his photographs.  his placement of lamps and the direct placement of the dolls in front of the lens are meant to recall formal photography, despite their humorous subject.  Svenson\'s desire to capture the distinct personality of all of Warren\'s sock monkeys reflects a certain charm, as well as reflecting the reasons why we take ourselves so seriously when it comes to portraiture.]]></BIO>

Messages scavenged from song lyrics, corporate creeds, philosophical treatises and political manifestos have been physically described and digitally scripted into the works.  Titchner also uses dizzying optical illusions and hypnotic animation to evoke an hallucinatory experience, emphasizing the fragility of our senses and understanding. - Tate Modern]]></BIO>

In viewing the landscape through a geommetric lens, Ziegler engages in a time honored tradition of artists who use mathmatics to echo the growth of nature.

In an interview with the Walker museum, Ziegler offered this apporach to viewing his work, \"When we decorate our homes with patterned carpets and wallpaper, maybe we are calibrating our living space, trying to define some bounderies within which to exhist.\"]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The everyday world of the domestic landscape provides the subject matter of The Ortho Rooms. Taking its name from the popular Ortho Books for home and garden care, this series of works blurrs perceptual distinctions between painting, photography and constructed reality. Set behind lenses, these foreshortened spaces occupy the hidden architecture of the wall, offering the viewer an encompassing and magical view of the mundane - a backyard overgrown with dandelions, a kitchen linoleum floor pierced by the leg of a stool, a downspout clogged with dead leaves.  - Patrick Jacobs]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[A modest suburban house landscaped with palm trees and decorated with a pine wreath, a serene yet ominous in-ground swimming pool, a solitary abandoned lawn chair. Converting the unused white sheet into an empty landscape, Doyle creates a juxtaposition of personal place with the void, highlighting the anxiety associated with unfulfilled domestic expectations. Together these poignant passages capture the disjointed psyche of the American landscape. - Jessica Murray Projects]]></BIO>

Shapes created by windows, buildings, and alleyways can be deciphered in her paintings.  Her sensitivity to symmetry, design, and planning is also reflected in her choice of size for her compositions.  The canvas becomes part of the grid, its thick edges resembling the foundation of an edifice.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Gilbert Garcin spent most of his life managing a lamp factory in France. At 65, he retired and took up a trick photography workshop. For the past ten years he has been creating comical, surrealistic photographs which warmly highlight sometimes cold, existential questions. Garcin inhabits this strange world and ponders it together with the viewer; with Garcin you have a dedicated, but perplexed, guide.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Artist Richard Renaldi lives and works in New York City.  Much of his work is based upon the idea of impromptu, spontaneous portraiture.  Using an old-fashioned looking camera, Renaldi hit the sidewalks of New York City\'s Madison Avenue in search of all the different personalities that populate this area known for its opulence and wealth.  Renaldi\'s resulting images feature the vast variety of people dressed to convey a certain image as they make their way down the Avenue.  He captures grand dames, children born into wealth, people who may have struggled hard to achieve theirs, and others who just want to blend in while working or window shopping.  Renaldi has several other series that focus on locations and the people that populate them.  Some of his most acclaimed works are images of people living with AIDS and HIV.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Adam Cvijanovic creates what he calls â€œscenic wallpaperâ€ -- grand scale landscape panoramas of mythic quality painted on Tyvek. He loosely models his concept on the 18th Century french tradition of printed wall landscapes for middle class consumption in imitation of the detail rich frescoed rooms of the aristocracy of the time. Cvijanovic takes on historically classic themes as well as much more contemporary views of the world we live in today.]]></BIO>

Not everything is what it seems to be.]]></BIO>

His work finds a history with surrealists and outsider artists, but a most direct comparison could be made to an artist like Frida Kahlo, who invogorated inanimate objects with living entities.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"Annexes append existing walls, or corners, opening up additional rooms where conventional annexes could not. These architectural forced perspective reliefs differ from the portals in that they do not represent a (nearly) 360Â° angle of vision (as with a fisheye lens) and so do not represent a (nearly) complete visual field. Annexes are based on a simple point-of-view idea, without the angle-of-view idea central to the portals. This point-of-view logic informs the specific idiosyncrasies of the tesseract as well: The ceiling and hence the imagined horizon line are on a significant tilt, and the top view of the gallery is not square (see drawing). Architecturally speaking, both plan and section contain tilted planes, coordinated to work together to form an integrated whole.\" - Andrew Kreps Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[John Timberlake: Statement on Another Country work, 1999-2001

Between 1999 â€“ 2001 I made a series of photographs entitled Another Country comprising dioramas and backdrops drawing from three distinct visual sources: the Romantic tradition of European landscape painting, principally Constable, Turner and Cozens; documentation of nuclear tests conducted by Britain between 1953 (the date of the first British atomic test) to 1958 (when Britain developed its first thermonuclear bomb), and the amateur model making of the type associated with miniature train and militaria enthusiasts. 

In these three elements â€“ which I unified in the final photograph â€“  I saw interesting contrasts in relation to depictions of history and landscape.  For example, the model making tradition is generally associated with a particular form of truth-telling: a better, more â€˜truthfulâ€™ model is generally regarded as one that has the most amount of detail. On the other hand, the Romantics had generally regarded the sketch or radically incomplete painting as more truthful than a complete Classicist rendering. The third element was the image of the nuclear test. I first encountered actual photographic prints of these in the archives of the Imperial War Museum in London. Alongside files full of documentation of actual military engagements and battles, there was file labeled â€˜Atomic Warâ€™. I was interested how the photographic documentation of nuclear tests was filed as if documentation of actual war.  Of course, as the tragic experience of veterans and â€˜down windersâ€™ of all nations1 where nuclear tests took place know, the effects on land and people were as if a small nuclear war had in fact taken place in those areas, and of course the tests took place during the Cold War era, but nevertheless, I was interested in the role that fiction â€“ the spectre of a war that never happened â€“ was used to label an archive of fact, so that the images of test clouds stood in for something else.  Looking at the nuclear cloud photos in early 1999, I was struck how the vividness of that particular iconography had changed since the end of the Cold War â€“ although of course the nuclear threat itself had not vanished, its representation had undergone some sort of shift in its cultural resonances.

The Romantic images I roughly transcribed were ones very much still in circulation as archetypal of the English and European landscape, even though they are around 200 years old: their mythologies and fictions continue to cast a long cultural shadow in discourses of landscape and its history.  Of course, the British nuclear tests actually took place on Australian Aboriginal lands or at Christmas Island (which were deemed to be mere â€˜desertâ€™ by European aesthetic sensibility), and in that sense there is a deliberate and provocative contrast insofar as these picturesque landscapes are haunted by the destruction that actually took place elsewhere.  In keeping with the project I bought a set of oil paints from a hobby shop, repainting successive backgrounds on the same canvas once Iâ€™d made each photograph. I made the foregrounds of the dioramas from paper-mache and household filler, and remodeled the figures from kits of soldiers with modeling putty. I shot on 120 colour negative film, and the works are all hand C-Prints, with no digital manipulation.

1 Carol Gallagherâ€™s moving photographic documentary book American Ground Zero (MIT Press, 1993) is recommended for readers interested in this legacy from the American perspective.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Timothy Tompkinsâ€™ work is executed on 1/8â€ thick aluminum panels using high gloss commercial enamels that enhance the liquid qualities of the paint. His paintings are a metaphor for his LA surroundings: the imagery, scenes of ordinary markets and buildings, is simultaneously hyper-real and manufactured. The original image is an existing photograph from his past, the media or one his own set-up photographs. They are then intentionally blurred, simplified and translated by hand on the aluminum. The liquid state of the paint is more evident with enamel paint because when itâ€™s dry, the traced contours of the image remain. This quality gives a transitory effect to the piece, as if the image is still forming.  His newer series studies the sale racks at stores like Target.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Palacioâ€™s color photographs capture details and fragments of familiar surroundings.  Teetering somewhere between the knowable and unknowable, these photographs point out the subtle oddities of daily life and reveal harmonies and delicate beauty in what we often over look.  Palacio captures what some might see as strange solutions, whether building fences around tree stumps, or a 10 inch tall picket fence to protect a pristine  lawn.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Glassford\'s early sculptures were based on local and natural materials (dried gourds, leather, chicharrÃŠn), but he has increasingly turned to more industrial and urban materials. Some of these are found, like embossed vinyl or plastic tableware, while others are modified, like the anodized aluminum siding used architectonically for gates and doorways that he special orders in a range of colors and patterns, and uses to create rhythmic wall reliefs that refer to the city while partaking in a dialogue with the vocabulary of minimalist painting and modernist architecture. The show presents new free-standing sculptures using melamine plates of the type used in school cafeterias and Mexican loncherÃ§as, assembled with precision and wit to form towers that can be read as futuristic utopian models, mission architecture, or even stupas.  - Julile Saul Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Valerie Merainsâ€š photographs are slick like travel posters. Some of the scenes appear to be tropical environments with luscious colors and succulent plants. In reality, these succulents are photographs of Plasticene blobs sitting in front of brightly colored (painted) backgrounds in Merainsâ€š studio.  The plant - figures and backgrounds are vibrantly colored with either a medium-red object against a green field, or a purple object against a light purple background, or in one case red-hot forms against a bright red field. 
Because all of the photographs are Untitled, viewers can associate the pictures loosely to landscape or to gaseous outer space, or maybe even heaven or hell. - Zing Magazine]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Exposito\'s paintings hint at a number of visual symbols;  especially alphabets and maps.  His taste for flat, one-dimensional planes and uncomplicated bands of color are refreshing and bold.  Their schematic layouts seem almost instructional, as if they are making concerted efforts to directly communicate ideas to viewers.  Yet their sense of logic and vectored appearance are a bit beguiling, as they are as open to interpretation as any other example of abstraction.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Mark Hosking\'s sculptural work is often described through narrative. Objects, remade and transformed by the artist, are seen as the residues of scenarios of self-preservation and redemption from adverse and unexpected situations or disasters. Another dimension to Hosking\'s practice rebels against the fixed status assigned to objects within western consumer society through challenging their former use-value.  -- Lisson Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Nic Nicosia is an internationally known who has a fascination with the gap between illusion and reality, especially as played out in middle-class American suburbia. Nicosia uses the paradoxically intimate and mundane settings of the bedroom, kitchen, or backyard as the back-drop for his photographs, but alters them by introducing obviously artificial conventions from movies and television. While he treats the subjects of his colorful narratives and character studies with affectionate humor, Nicosia also reveals darker realities of desire, violence, and isolation that lie beneath the surface of his artificial worlds. Nevertheless, he avoids passing judgment on his troupe of characters, leaving viewers to reach their own conclusions about the values and personas encountered in his works.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Alison Jackson creates films, photographic images and sculptures about our fixation with fame and celebrity culture.   These Mimeses use look-a-likes of celebrities and public figures to create a photographic or filmic image, which challenges the observers\' perception of reality by creating a false reality.   Only on second or third glance does the viewer question the truth of what they are seeing.   Jackson describes her work as an exploration of what we see and what we imagine, the interplay of our voyeuristic needs and our urge to believe, challenging the photographs\' claim to tell the truth.   Jackson is an astute observer of the contemporary cult of celebrity.   Her reinterpretations of familiar media images have shocked, provoked, amused, and most importantly caused an entire generation to re-assess its perceptions and expectations of modern-day Icons.]]></BIO>

My fascination with this animal has evolved from exploring it as a two- dimensional subject to using it as the medium itself. My bejeweled chicken skulls interplay the image of the hen and all her connotations with the rugged machismo associated with large, exotic, mounted game. In this body of work I appropriate trendy and clichÃ©d accoutrements of femininity, exploiting the color pink and using rhinestones as accents.  In a new series, I have broadened my vocabulary to construct a â€œtrophy wallâ€ of farm animals and beloved pets. These larger skulls are adorned in a fashion similar to the smaller pieces. Each skull is candy-coated in hues of glossy enamel and decorated with a memorial portrait of the animal along with a fictional name, habitat or owner. Tiny rhinestones are used as accents that draw attention to the marvelous intricacies of the skulls with their many hollows, fragile projections, and lacy contours. Sculpted horns that mimic deer horns adorn each piece, large and small. Each skullâ€™s tender decoration evokes the intimacy of a fetish object, while their large sculpted horns imply a more grandiose history.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Chris Sauter is converting familiar objects into other familiar objects.  HIs focus is on changing domestic items that are in our visual vocabulary, superimposing them into different forms.  In Generator, Sauter carves away pieces of our daily life.    In other pieces he wraps over objects with familiar fabrics, to create these hybrids of forms. The relationships are not arbitrary, the ironing board is sued for preparing clothing as a mill prepares  lumber.  As water eats away stone for canyon, body  contorts mattress to form impressions and indentations over time.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Pankin builds his sculptures primarily from small shards of
splintered wood, cobbled together in disorderly clusters, topped with the occasional tree. Whether mounted on the
wall or free-standing, they suggest craggy natural landscapes, futuristic cities or exploding architectural models. They are intricate, elaborate and often strenuously gravity-defying -- many pieces are cantilevered several feet from the wall -- but the consistency of materials gave them a
monochromatic quality that, while elegant at times, still suggested a crafty, wood shop sensibility.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œSpanish artist Gonzalo Puch lives and works in Madrid.  In his work, Puch creates situations and â€œincidentsâ€, generally in neutral environments such as classrooms and apartments.  In â€œGlobusâ€, Puch lies on the floor under  a paper globe comprised of a collage of maps which have been recombined without a logical order, surrounded by tools attempting to inflate it.â€ -- Julie Saul Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Benson uses a method of collage-as-painting: painstakingly made by first applying acrylic paint to glass, and, once dry, cutting and affixing it to canvas. Bensonâ€™s paintings of corporate office towers, strip-malls and graffiti-scarred highway barriers appear at once as delicately balanced, nearly abstract compositions of geometric color, and also as particularly beautiful condensations of highly poetic loneliness. Bensonâ€™s views of the most ordinary of 21st Century landscapes distill, like most great art, a uniquely important measure of mystery and power from exactly those vistas that remain unexamined.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[This new series looks at contemporary American culture through the austere lens of statistics. Each image portrays a specific quantity of something: fifteen million sheets of office paper (five minutes of paper use); 106,000 aluminum cans (thirty seconds of can consumption) and so on. My hope is that images representing these quantities might have a different effect than the raw numbers alone, such as we find daily in articles and books. Statistics can feel abstract and anesthetizing, making it difficult to connect with and make meaning of 3.6 million SUV sales in one year, for example, or 2.3 million Americans in prison, or 426,000 cell phones retired every day. This project visually examines these vast and bizarre measures of our society, in large intricately detailed prints assembled from thousands of smaller photographs. - Chris Jordan]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Nothing is more pure than the anguish of a child. Pictures of children crying capture raw emotion sputtering rage and profound loss. In many ways weâ€™ve become desensitized to disturbing images. But the honesty of a childâ€™s feelings is undeniable and it draws you in to the kind of powerful motions that we, as adults, have suppressed in ourselves. For the series â€œMonkey Portraitsâ€, Greenberg has created a series of monkey portraits and asks us to consider, in another way, where we are coming from.  We look into her monkeyâ€™s expressions, their faces -- their peculiar physiognomy -- and somehow see ourselves.  It is frightening and disorienting and exhilarating and awesome.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"My drawings and paintings emerge as a form of interplay between various conditions such as abstraction/figuration, proximity/distance, movement/stillness. Shadow, light and color use their own logic â€” no longer delimiting objects, but suggesting their underlying unity.  The work forms like a virus, proliferating, shifting directions, plotting and transforming the space. The elements appear near and far, dense clusters disperse into the whiteness of the paper. Juxtaposition of microscopic and boundless, familiar and strange creates an interplay of opposing forces. Tensions explode in chaos, disrupting any attempt at containment.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Amy Bennett designs and constructs a 1:87 scale model neighborhood using model railroad miniatures, landscaping supplies, and dollhouse lighting to use as a still life for her paintings.  â€œBy considering the layout of the street and the relationship of one house to another, I am prompted me to imagine the character of individual families, and the ways in which they may interact and connect. My imagination fills each house with history, memories of significant events or moments, traditions, and daily rituals. The act of building models plays a critical role in triggering my imagination to develop images. The model becomes a stage on which to develop the psychological implications of belonging to a particular family, with all of its dramas, struggles and familiar routines. I think: this tree will be taken down after an old man crashes into it; a father will transform this lawn into an ice skating rink; this house will be abandoned after its residents are scandalized on the evening news.  In the same way that we develop our concept of home, I have created these images, through memory, personal experience and imagination. One of my challenges is to invite the viewer to form his or her own connection and narrative, whereby he may empathize with the occupantsâ€™ seemingly mundane existence.â€ - Amy Bennett]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œThe Processionâ€ features former heads of states, exiled or dethroned leaders, bizarrely squeezed into their stately limousines and taking part in a ceremonial procession. Clearly past their days of power and glory, these former statesmen are still defiant as they advance their final judgment or perhaps a sympathetic host country. Once heroes or convenient allies they are now rendered as corrupt dictators haunting our collective memories as a continuous parade of deflated, defeated and delusional figures.]]></BIO>

In her use of wood veneer, Taylor subverts the material\'s customary use as a decorative element used to convey a sense of wealth, power, and elite social status.  Taylor\'s oblique narratives refer to mainstream American culture and interests - large vehicles, sex, guns, video games, religion, hunting, and the military.  -  Durham Press]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Yuken Teruya is adept at transforming objects using very modest, intimately-scaled gestures. In Notice Forest, the artist subtly draws our attention to the effects of consumerism and globalism -- alluding to the depletion of fragile natural resources, the disappearance of cultural traditions and identities, and the distribution of wealth in the new world order. Working with discarded paper bags from takeout joints such as McDonald\'s and Krispy Kreme, commercial gift bags and post office packages, Teruya creates delicately rendered shadowboxes in which the sculptural form cut out from the container is shaped by the container itself. Using photography as the starting point, Teruya photographs trees he encounters in his daily life and then painstakingly recreates the form of the individual trees as paper cutouts that are suspended inside the bags. Light filters down through the holes to illuminate the tiny tree within each bag\'s miniature interior landscape in what the Teruya describes as his attempt to return a spent consumer product back to the forest.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Jennifer Steinkamp creates high definition projections of individual trees with twirling branches inspired by a ritual practiced by the priests, or dervishes, of the Mevlavi sect of Islam. In the midst of a trance, the dervishes whirl in a motion symbolizing the soul\'s release from earthly ties and communication with the divine. The movement of the branches contains elements of both control and lawlessness -- while the whirling motion of the trees is fanciful and seemingly enchanted, the movement is limited by the roots of the trees.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Keith Garcia lives and works in Philadelphia. His paintings are parqueted together to create a fictitious world that consists of reinvented images of himself, friends, celebrities, and media figures which are used to reflect an uncertain and ambiguous serenity. These scenes unify to build a pent-up feeling of aggression in a peaceful yet deceiving environment, in a place where constant fear of danger, incarceration, or captivity is evident. the added use of fonts and various symbols provoke an emotion that is similar to exploring a foreign place where innocence and unruliness can go hand in hand. the topics are somewhat dark and dismal ~~ yet there is still a sense of delight, as a hint of irony exists that acts as a parallel for the infusion of contrasting bright colors throughout each piece.]]></BIO>

There is further a constant interchange between real images of the street and a projection from the visual culture...

    <BIO><![CDATA[It is around the concept of ‘home’ and the intangible qualities associated with dwelling that many of my ideas converge: familiarity and strangeness, belonging and migration, prolonged routine and repetition. The Sustenance series is a body of photographs that examines these complexities within the domestic environment. Here, various species of birds coming to feed at the apartment balcony of my former home in Framingham, Massachusetts become the subject of exploration, with their activities documented using a large-format camera. 
These images are not typical avian pictures, as the birds do not dominate the frame to the exclusion of all else. Each large-scale Iris print is an exaggerated impression of reality rather than a fabrication of it. Formal devices such as artificial lighting, as well as, the selective use of focus and magnification create a slippage between the perception of what is natural or manufactured.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The primary sources for James Riecks imagery are retail advertisements or photographs that have a consumer agenda of selling (ideas, people or things). By extreme cropping and altering the scale of the images, the artist heightens the commercial posturing of the initial subject yet negates its benign commercial aspects by re-contextualizing the composition without the lexicon of the sale. This process necessitates a reevaluation both aesthetically and psychologically of how commercialism invades our personal space.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œThis on-going series has developed my interest in images of Glamour and Power and how these have changed during the last 50 years. My feelings about the Royals are ambivalent, I am simply fascinated by the institution and it\'s relationship to the press and public. My political position is neither republican nor monarchist. I am interested in producing powerful, magical images of the Royal Family and I find it strange that this could be viewed as being a perverse act for a Black artist.â€ - Hew Locke]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My work deals with physical and pictoral occurrences in nature. Through curious observation I find infinite instances in which natural order and disorder create framework. For example, fractured light through broken glass or a web of tree branches intertwining through a matrix of space. Wound Together, the pictures I make float in and out of illusory space while simultaneously denoting flatness of their plane materiality. Surprisingly an arhythmical rhythm emerges in all this. What excites me is the beauty and its unpredictability. Through Collage I take something as a whole, then break it down and reassemble it through my own filter. Layers are built up but are done so in order to subtract from the overall image and create voids in the landscape of the imagery. The uniqueness to my process adapts a traditional ‘cut and paste’ approach but also carries seamlessness equally redolent of digitized media.  -  Aaron Wexler]]></BIO>

biomorphic abstractions â€“ shiny gloss paint on heavy-weight aluminium boards, 
partly covered in acrylic, accentuated by detailed ink drawings â€“ are a 
constant work in progress. They constitute a whole, a functionally linked body. 
All of David Jonesâ€˜s paintings are entitled Implosive Neuro 
Polymorphism/Conjoined Arena/Section...: they can be distinguished by a serial 
numeral (cipher) at the end acting as an indicator for the further physical and 
psychological development of the cycle. The term node alludes to the amount of 
contrasting elements which are intersected in such a way that they seem to 
implode in each painting. -- Upstairs Berlin]]></BIO>

The artist continues Klee\'s idea of \'taking a line for a walk\' by beginning his drawings with a single mark and allowing them to grow organically and automatically. The resulting scenes, painstakingly composed from thousands of minute, individual shapes, reveal rugged mountains, plunging valleys, and other environments of physical and psychological unease. \"---taken from Museum 52 Press Release]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œMost recently I have started making white paper cuts/sculptures inspired by fairytales and romanticism exploring the relationship between two and three dimensionality, between image and reality. I find the materialization of a flat piece of paper into a 3D form as an almost magic process - or maybe one could call it obvious magic, because the process is obvious and the figures still stick to their origin, without the possibility of escaping. In that sense there is also an aspect of something tragic in most of the cuts.â€]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Mexican-American Artist, Margarita Cabrera\'s life-sized Hummer presents a malleable image of a war symbol. In scale, the H2 maintains its status as an American icon and symbol of military might. Its soft veneer, however, refers to its role as a disposable luxury item that is manufactured in her native county, Mexico. Mass produced by anonymous laborers for the few who can afford them, the Hummer embodies multiple metaphors, all fundamentally rooted in the American realities of power and desire, excess, consumerism and waste. War and wealth collapse into a singular image that speaks to our current moment in history and its byproduct: popular American culture.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In Mellor\'s paintings, events and passages exist which at first glance induce the viewer to establish the relationship with different parts of the work, then to absorb the entirety of the work. A painting will meander between recognizable and unfamiliar. Each application of color shakes the foundations of previously applied paint. Colors are free from their designations to interact and often compete for attention. The same applies to the bold graphic quality of articulated pattern.  Mellor has created his own, unique form of beauty, where he willingly pairs hard edge lines, disparate forms, patterns and colors, changes the quality of paint from lustrous to flat, and shifts spatial hierarchies.]]></BIO>

We live in a culture where we are both â€œchild centeredâ€ and â€œself-obsessed.â€  The struggle between living in the moment versus escaping to another reality is intense since these two opposites strive to dominate.  Caught in the swirl of soccer practices, play dates, work, and trying to find our way in our â€œmake-overâ€ culture, we must still create the space to find ourselves.  The expectations of family life have never been more at odds with each other.  These issues, as well as the relationship between the domestic landscape of the past and present, are issues I have explored in these photographs.â€  -Julie Blackmon]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Britton makes drawings on paper and paintings on canvas. They vary in size from inches up to eight feet and have dense, dynamic compositions. He paints evidence of a landscape or cultural setting and includes possibilities for multiple approaches to painting in the same scene. His work is about a world that appears to threaten itself. 

His subjects are derived from personal strategies of picture-making including recollection of specific events, myths, stories, and landscapes. The drawings and paintings contain passages of illusionist rendering and abstract gesture. By manipulating a matrix of unnamed connective tissue between painted objects, he aims to create a motif that draws to it the sensorial sympathies of the viewer.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In order for Roth to create his photograph, he takes hundreds of digital pictures of one location or subject.  He then creates an image that incorporates various elements from the hundreds of digital images and seamlessly recomposing them in a constructed image that more closely resembles what was seen by the naked eye.  Roth creates idealized spatial concepts that rely on radically manipulating perspectives, axes, sizes and proportions.  It is in the process of viewing that the viewer may unzip Rothâ€™s bag of tricks, tracking down all of the artistâ€™s visible computer-graphical manipulations become a game of obsessive viewing.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Alison Brady hails from the slightly tattered outskirts of Cleveland, Ohio, and the image of faded middle-class \"coziness\" is one that lies at the heart of her photos.  The result is a compelling, funny, and disturbing body of work that mucks through unconscious emotions, desires, and sexual compulsions, all unified by an aesthetic that vacillates between the banal and the fantastic. Issues related to madness and alienation take shape, exploring feelings of anxiety, displacement, and loss of identity.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"Mary Henderson could be broadly recognized as a Contemporary Realist painter. Her deftness of hand recalls the Photorealism of painters such as Richard Estes or Ralph Goings while her subject matter and compositions are much more aligned with the spirit of contemporary representational artists like Tim Gardner.  Her gouache on paper paintings are no larger than 11â€ X 14â€ and  the subject matter of this body of work explores the world of elite high school girls. For Mary, her interest in this arena is highly personal: she attended an all-girlsâ€™ prep school in Los Angeles, and then later taught at a similar institution in Philadelphiaâ€™s Main Line suburbs. Both schools were filled with students very much as the girls depicted in these images - the kind of girls who will describe each other as â€œsmart and pretty.â€ As something of an outsider in these cliquish settings, Mary was simultaneously drawn to and alienated from these girls. Mary found, and still finds, so much to admire in them: they are seemingly smart, accomplished, poised, and beautiful in a natural and almost effortless way. At the same time, there is something foreign and mysterious in the uncomplicated confidence they appear to bring to their lives.\"----from Lyons Wier Ortt Press Release]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"Dark Papers is the name Annegret Haas has chosen for her new works on paper. The monochrome drawings depict landscape segments, buildings, rooms, object details, and, occasionally, human figures. Haas\'s approach alternates between detached observation and the evocation of specific moods. Some of her work seems to depict movement, reminiscent of photographs taken from a moving vehicle. Her method of working frequently uses video stills as a point of departure from which a series of steps leads to rigorous compositions of stylized landscapes. Haas\'s concept involves arranging individual drawings into larger groups; her motifs range from the serene to the dynamic, both incorporating Romantic quotes and dealing with questions relating to the modern mass-production of images.\"---from Fruehsorge Press Release Berlin]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Tobias Waite examines a disconnect from environment in his paper collage work.  Figures and objects exist in layers, more specifically, in separate planes.  Between these planes, they experience failed attempts to interact.  The efforts of characters to actually relate beyond their planes are literally impossible.  So despite a seemingly tangible relationship with environment and others, no such relationship is actually achieved.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Joseph Smolinski comments on the relationship between technology and humans. Yet there is a darker, futuristic side to Smolinski\'s work.  His delicate and beautifully drawn works on paper of hybrid tree-cell towers (or power stations) make  us realize how absurd some of our man-made structures are.   Should we camouflage cell towers to look like large tree?   Smolinski comes right out with new absurd combinations in these sketches and he suggests a bit of hope too in that some of these ideas might actually work to generate power and preserve nature.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Michael Wolf lived in Hong Kong for 10 years where he focused on the \"Architecture of Density\" project.  \"In 2002, the San Francisco Chronicle called Wolf\'s work in Hong Kong \"most improbable and humanly alert\". In previous series, Wolf described the vernacular culture of the street. His early vision of the region dwelt on personal aesthetic gestures left in back doors and alleyways, such as makeshift seating in the streets. In these photographs, small tokens of human presence took precedence over monumental architecture. Wolf continues to explore the theme of the organic metropolis- that which develops according to the caprice of its citizens as much as the planning of its architects. In Architecture of Density, his vision has evolved to evaluate the high-rises that shape the spatial experience of Hong Kong\'s citizens. Wolf finds in each building a singular character, despite its functional purpose and massive form.\"---taken from \"Architecture of Density\" press release, Robert Koch Gallery]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"The imaginary world of Aurelia Gratzer is a purely pictorial one. The various tasks in the history of painting are reflected in her paintings and find their execution in a very subjective manner. For centuries the art of painting solely existed in order to ban reality on the canvas – the so called view out of the window – yet Aurelia Gratzer intentionally questions (its possibility) copying itself. The basis of her work are photos, partly taken by her, partly taken from magazines. The space confronting us, are the means to the end. Her central perspective projection of the rooms is divided into single fields. By working carefully along she achieves the advancement of her pictures, similar to a film script, by splitting the copy (template) into painting quotations of areas and changing it in her own exciting three dimensional way. There is no room for pure chance, even though Aurelia Gratzer recently tolerates a variation from this self set plan.\" --  Eva-Maria Bechter]]></BIO>

The thin wooden cable running down from the stereo to the floor and to a sculpted plug, is made up of short sections of straight balsa to give the impression of a curve.  This is his practice, the attentive re-fabrication of every day objects; by exhaustively re-creating almost any object in view he builds up still-lifes, then multiplies them into environments, ultimately re-locating rendered places.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Korean artist Yong Ho Ji creates life-size sculptures of animals and predators out of discarded automobile tires. Sometimes, his sculptures take the form of mutant combinations of humans and animals. The tires function as a metaphor for musculature, meant to be less of a commentary on recycling or consumerism and more about aggression and forms of life mutated from centuries of evolutionary changes. The conceptual combination of hunting trophies with our planet\'s ubiquitous industrial waste makes the viewer question the future of known lifeforms.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I still consider myself a painter and find it difficult not to refer to these embroidered portraits as “paintings”. Although the medium employed is crewel embroidery wool, the technique borrows more from the worlds of drawing and painting.

Initially, working with an established range of wool colors proved frustrating. Unlike painting, I was unable to mix the colors by hand. Progressively, I created a system of sewing the threads in a sequence that would ultimately give the allusion of a certain color or tone. The direction in which the threads were sewn had to mimic the way lines are layered in a drawing to give the allusion of depth, volume, and form. Over time the stitches have become tighter and more complex but ultimately more evocative of flesh, hair, and cloth.

My work unabashedly nods its head to the tradition of tapestry and my own love of craft. Using wool instead of oils has allowed me to broaden the dialogue between portrait and process as well as propose a new definition for the word “painting”. - Cayce Zavaglia]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[New Zealand-born Dutch artist Dylan Graham creates hand-cut paper works that exhibit a superlative technique of the most intricate virtuosity. The cutouts depict silhouettes of three-dimensional forms held together by a repetitive grid with filigree-style embellishments. Opting not to use high-tech processes, he allows his hand to show through the ornately decorated narrative grids that follow in the folk art tradition of papel picado, or perforated paper. - NY Arts]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Built primarily from the affordable design retailer’s furniture, Jeff Carter’s new sculptures—all appropriately entitled
Catalog —use IKEA not only for its modern forms, but also for its conceptual content. Like Apple, Target, or any other corporation that has harnessed the political power of Jeff Carter and IKEA:  Movement as Material, simple utilitarian design, the aesthetic of IKEA has been absorbed into the everyday. Carter’s use of the brand’s signature items
is a clever extension of his ongoing study of how tourism and movement relate to the construction of place. Where past works employed items from Carter’s experiences in China, Sri Lanka and Indonesia, and focused on the experience of cultural difference, the Catalog series is the inverse; it examines the experience of repetition and the production of the same. - College of DuPage]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I am a multi-disciplinary installation artist. I create installations and sculptures based on my understanding of how the idea of violence and power is constructed through symbolic objects and information in our society and history. Often, my art practice becomes a way of measuring distances between myself and things that are personally unacceptable. I am interested in how those symbolic motifs from our contemporary society and history evoke personal stories and issues in viewers mind.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The series â€˜The fly womanâ€™ from Amparo Sard started three years ago. At the beginning of this series a lot of flies were helping a woman (she) in different situations to do something or to let her react somehow. It was talking about a metaphor. The fly represents the society that makes us to be part of a common core with a similar identity, to be as chameleon and thus survey socially.  In last works of this series the protagonist is not lead by the fly, now she is able to take a choice in front of a problem but she does not what to do. In those works she is trying to represent the anguish of the indecision. I am making eternal this moment of indecision, a moment that normally takes some seconds. She is static in papers not only because is a â€˜drawingâ€™ (made with holes) but also because she is waiting for the right choice. So that the moment of anguish becomes eternal. The important element and referent here is the water that is filling the space of the drawing while she doesnâ€™t react.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œMy work explores gender permissions and the challenges that arise from straying from the prescribed norms. It questions the qualities of gender by considering what constitutes masculine and feminine. It critiques stereotypical gender mediums by creating \"masculine objects\" using \"feminine processes\" such as crochet, sewing, and applique.â€ - Nathan Vincent]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œLiving on the east coast made me acutely aware of the aesthetics of my Midwestern upbringing. My experiences in New York and at Yale University cast my family\'s home and lifestyle in a different light; a pragmatic, mundane (and rather flat) sense of beauty, unburdened by high ideas or refinements of style. The combination of my earlier working class tastes and the later-acquired, intensely cosmopolitan awareness of style has shaped who I am as a painter- a combo of Grandma Moses and Matisse.â€ - Ann Toebbe]]></BIO>

It explores how our ever-expanding consumer culture has shaped the environments in which we live. My paintings are shiny postcards that depict these monuments of contemporary America, reflecting the viewerâ€™s own image back to them, blending them into the landscape, making them a tourist in an unknown yet familiar place, an environment where everywhere is nowhere in particular simultaneously.â€ - Jonas Criscoe]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œMy work mines the debris of memory through the creation of intricate worlds sculpted in 1:43 scale and smaller. Often sealed under glass, the works depict the remnants of things pastâ€”experiences frozen and distorted by a warped and dreamlike lens. As a child, I spent hours peering into museum dioramas, building shoebox dollhouses, and laboring over military models. After years of feeling limited by traditional media, I cast about for a better fitâ€¦ and somehow ended up back where I started.â€ - Thomas Doyle]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œEver since I studied documentary photography in Essen I ponder about about the concepts of visual documentation. Is there something like a photographic representation of reality? How does the shape of things and the appearance of reality reflect peopleÂ´s attitude towards it? What is a documentation of a place that does not exist? The works in my \"landscape\" series are all digitally altered and / or constructed from several photographic images yet appear authentic at the same time.â€ - George Parthen]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[James Johnsonâ€™s primary interest lies in creating illusions. He makes objects, imagery, and participatory situations that are meant to be visually alluring but also somewhat confounding or perplexing to the people who encounter them. The work usually has two parts: a faÃ§ade and a back-end. The back-end contains the materials and equipment that create the illusion as seen by the viewer while standing in front of the faÃ§ade. Occasionally the back-end is left open for the viewer to explore.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[â€œMy videos and photographs examine paper as both a physical object and as a malleable document of the real. The imagery often relies on theatrical manipulation or illusion, but uses these mechanisms in order to inform or expand the meaning or reading of the imagery, rather than trick the viewer. My recent work employs video animation and photographic \'re-constructions\' that exploit the theatricality of architecture and landscape as a platform to spotlight the iconic and political structures of sports stadia.â€ - Rob Carter]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My work explores psychologically charged spaces and objects that trigger childlike feelings of awe, awkwardness, fear, and isolation. Using materials and techniques from theater props, toys, tents and furniture I make objects that combine the evocative, narrative, and flat qualities of drawing and painting with the physical presence and material range of sculpture. I am interested in the tension that exists between the structural and formal properties of the work and its representational aims. - Sharon Levy]]></BIO>

Political and social issues come through in the narrative, but again not the focus. I am telling a story, creating a world that in many ways reflects our own. The animals in this world deal with issues just as we do. They have social relationships, varying religious beliefs, love, family, crime, work, and so on.]]></BIO>

For this series of paintings I began with a literal, if not impractical attempt to represent, as accurately as possible, the portrait of an individual hidden from view, disguised by the covering of a mask.  Through a process of gathering and sorting through images of individuals wearing masks, gleaned from a variety of contexts, I discovered the metaphorical potential of these images to represent—through a careful and deliberate method of painting—the desire to understand what remains hidden from view. By meticulously rendering a portrait of an individual whose identity remains concealed, I intend to present a contemplative way of understanding an already loaded and overstated image, while taking into account the contradiction indicative to the representation of someone hidden. The mask, evoking various yet familiar associations from terrorist to prisoner, superhero to villain, and religious figure to thief, stands as an anonymous reminder of the fear of what we do not know and what we do not understand—provoking difficult questions of identity concerning the very designations assigned by it.  - Julie Weitz]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I build sculptures of scenes and objects from daily life that I find interesting.    I try to impart my sense of wonder and even enchantment in each object. My choices in selecting subjects are intuitive, but once I get interested and I see potential I do work with references, preferably photographs of the subjects.    Once I have my photographs completed, I then start working from scratch to build the scene.  Working this way, and with the materials I use, I try to give a fresh and direct point of view about daily life we all meet and experience.   In \"The LOST Project,\" 
I created the cast of the popular TV show again using modeling clay.  It was extremely interesting to create and exhibit details that are highly recognized 
(in Israel and the US), and bring them to life with the simple, at hand, material of modeling clay.  My interest is in the playful side of art, so I took my figures to the beach and presented them in a wheelbarrow, shared them with viewers and photographed them in that location.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Camper Kart is a small pop-up camper affixed to a shopping cart. It is a functioning sculptural piece that seeks to explore aspects of housing, habitat, mobility, and autonomy. It is also emblematic of self-reliance and human perseverance.
 
The project was inspired by Cormac McCarthy’s novel, The Road, in which a father and son struggle to survive in a post-apocalyptic world pushing a shopping cart filled with their meager belongings.
 
Although the shopping cart was once associated with middle-class prosperity, it has been recontextualized—especially in urban areas—to be associated with homelessness and poverty. Camper Kart does not aim to provide a solution to social issues, but is partly a reaction to materialism and excess. The current economy has forced many people to make do with less. The spirit of frugality is something that we often embrace after it becomes a necessity, but can be liberating nonetheless.
 
The piece also exemplifies nostalgic impulses. The cart is equipped with items from the 1980’s, a period in my childhood when camping was a frequent family activity. It is stocked with a camping stove, cast iron skillet, lantern, cooler, drinking containers, knives, and hatchet—all supplies to ensure a basic level of comfort—and a cassette player for amusement..]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Leah Bailis\' sculptures meticulously re-create mass-produced structures with fragile, temporal materials such as cardboard, Styrofoam, and craft wood. The restriction implied by the structures is made self-imposed by the fragility of the material, while the fastidiousness of its construction suggests a contained anxiety. This duplicity creates a tension as the clean, pared-down surfaces give an outward appearance of calm that crumbles upon closer inspection.]]></BIO>

He spent the last years exploring the ideas of artificiality and replication and how these concepts reflect contemporary culture. A satirical interpretation of the term Natural Selection, the work implements artificial objects and composes them into recognizable pictorial traditions. This series pulls together a variety of elements historically contextualizing the work while leaving a contemporary message.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My sculptures and installations respond to quotidian objects and commonplace spaces, taking visual clues and materials from these forms to create a simultaneous secondary experience of an object or an entire location. Techniques of repetition create visual tension between the original and the intervention, between the existent object and the imagined object, and by interjecting illogical components into the systems, the work investigates the relationship between reality and perception.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Since childhood I have experienced different cultures and social mechanisms, contrary opinions and paradoxical points of view. Through these experiences I\'ve learned not to believe in the absolute values of events or materials, I       support a constant flux in which each one of us contributes to the mutability of each parameter. I reconstruct objects, symbols of personal status, identity and value by replacing the materials to confusing one\'s sense of judgement. I aim at shifting the parameters set by society; to induce doubt about what we believe to be \'reality\': all the things we take for granted through \'conditioned perception\'.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I make photographic collages and pop-up books. Pop-up and flap books originally illustrated ideas about astronomy, fortune telling, navigation, anatomy of the body and other scientific principles. This history prompted me to construct my own books reflecting ideas on how our selves relate to society today. My work allows me to speak, mediate, express, delight and inform. Constructing pop-ups allows me to combine intuitive design and technical acuity with my love of traveling as I try to understand the world around me. With all my work I want to eliminate the boundaries between book, installation, photography, craft and sculpture.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[\"Kyohei was born in Nagoya, Japan and earned his Bachelor’s Degree of Science in Architecture from Trident College in Japan. He later moved to the United States and began studying photography at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit, Michigan.
His clean, conceptual work is incredibly appealing and though he doesn\'t reveal his intentions, the power of the imagery leaves room for imagination and contemplation.\" -Lenscratch]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The idea of piecing-together disparate elements (pipe cleaners, plastic bags & pins) strongly informs my work. The installations take various forms: parasitic-like growths that cover interior architectural elements & outdoors structures; hanging tents that immerse the viewer; suspended walls that curve & divide spaces; excessive, organic masses that transform room into caves. Monumental in scale & intensely colored & textured, the work aims to physically affect the viewer.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I like to playfully reveal the shortcomings and failures of contemporary technologies, industries and lifestyles. In my work I modify and repurpose specific objects such as newspaper boxes, propane tanks, or a gas pump. These now comment on the cultures and industries that produced them. Industrial design and engineering constantly inspire my works, co-mingling with influences of Pop and minimalist explorations of color, form and space.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[This has always been the work of art: to inspire the senses-to make the body feel-without necessarily direct experience, through signs, colors, sounds, movement, and so on. At its highest, the experience and the making of art are identical. Accordingly my work is usually interactive and kinetic in nature. I strive to make pieces in which the viewer interface is both the form and function of the piece. I want people to remember themselves, in much the same way that babies discover their fingers.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Creating works on paper that incorporate a variety of media, my depictions of a near-future strive to explore the fragility of our current society and the physical infrastructure built to support it. Through scenes of devastated landscapes, crumbling foundations, overturned trucks and telling signs of human despair, I look to examine our cultural fascination surrounding our national mortality as well as the desensitization to the aesthetics of destruction.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My work is made from product labels I purchase in unused bundles. I cut and arrange this material onto flat surfaces (paper, canvas, or wood) to produce artworks that appear woven. I use repetition and pattern to distract from the original purpose of the label to sell a product. The labels are often leftover from defunct products and can be from as far back as the 1930\'s. The material is seductive, and the thrill of finding and collecting is an exciting part of the process.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[For the past 5 years I have been researching, working with biologists and traveling the world to photograph continuously living organisms 2,000 years old an older. The project, called \"The Oldest Living Things in the World\", is part art and part science, with an underlying environmental component. It\'s also intended to provide a lens in which to consider Deep Time. The Oldest Living Things are a celebration of our past, a call to action in the present, and a barometer of our future.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[In recent drawings of vernacular architecture I employ classicizing elements and unusual perspectives to draw out the embedded information inherent in all human-built structures. On this seemingly abandoned and portentous empty stage one can contemplate the history of architecture, the humor of \"bad\" architecture, and the human experience within. My paintings deal with similar themes in a more intimate way by presenting individual portraits of buildings. In titling the work I borrow from the language of architecture to further add weight and meaning to these typically inconsequential structures.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I am interested in how the ideas of agency and power regulate our private and individual freedoms. Through my experiences in the Korean military, I was forced to live in an environment of intense control that seemed to parallel social mechanisms. This has served as a catalyst for much of my ongoing artistic inquiry. I want to pose a question through my work: how does reality become exquisitely animated by certain control systems such as politics, mass media, advertisement, etc.? Furthermore, I want to reveal how human beings are fragile and delicate in these environments.]]></BIO>

Employing a mass of translucent fabric and dark colored thread, the artist\'s latest realization of this complex and, at times, fragile relationship is captured in a group of sculptural installations. Deslauriers lives and works in Montreal, Quebec.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Fahamu Pecou\'s work can be viewed as meditations on contemporary popular culture.  he began his career experimenting with practices employed in branding strategies.  The experiments ultimately led him to question the media\'s role in perpetuating certain racial stereotypes.  He adopts popular representations of black masculinity in media and distorts or exaggerates them through appropriation.  Pecou appears in his work not in an allegorical sense, but instead as a stand-in for the realities and fantasies of these representations.  The end result is a parody on our culture\'s obsession with celebrity as well as its exploitation of black masculinity.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My process begins with the photographic documentation of graffiti I encounter in the surrounding urban landscapes of Mexico City and other places around the World that I have visited.  My work appropriates the artisan technique of the Huichol people that consists in painting the surface with colorful threads held in place and glued to the surface with natural bee\'s wax.  I reinterpret the graffiti imagery to give the viewer the experience of intimacy and curiosity, transforming their encounter from aggressive, bodily and masculine experience into a more delicate, manual and feminine one.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The works were created in Shanghai in 2009-2010.  With its reputation as one of China\'s most important centers of industry and business, the city also stands for the country\'s booming economic progress.  Unlike the predominant media image of China as a place defined by the masses, Delorme\'s works focus on individuals:  migrants from the Chinese provinces, whom he photographed on the city streets - laborers who are substantially responsible for the country\'s rapid economic progress.  Hence, the big piles also symbolize society\'s immoderate consumption and thus make the individual disappear almost entirely.]]></BIO>

He is one of the most visible contemporary artists breaking through to international recognition from a post-Katrina New Orleans. Tague\'s work points to inadequacies in government policy toward education, environmental health, and financial reform and unapologetically stresses the zero sum nature of greed and neglect. His work is in the collections of the Whitney Museum of Art, the Weisman Foundation, and many private collections across the globe.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The White Trash Series was developed while living in the South out of frustration with some of the prevailing ideologies, in particular, class distinction. This ideology seemed based on a combination of myth, biased history and bizarre sentimentality about old wars and social structures. With the juxtaposition of the portraits from museums, once painted on ivory, now on flattened trash of beer cans and fast food, the artist sets to even the playing field, challenging the perception of the social elite in todays society.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Mark Stockton is a draughtsman invested in the intimacy of the hand-made. He is fascinated with a vernacular of American pop culture imagery. Inspired by historical drawings and prints, he employs portraiture to depict contemporary icons with complex -sometimes tragic- life stories. His practice involves time-intensive traditional techniques, adding a level of investment to fleeting subjects. Through this labor, he reproduces the synthetic product of media imagery through intimately human means.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Since 2008, I have been creating large-scale screen prints of furniture, based on images from my childhood and on other people\'s descriptions of their childhood homes.  I am by nature a nostalgic person and am very interested in how an object as mundane as a salad spinner an embody vivid memories of people, events, and periods of someone\'s life.  By working with other people\'s memories I am creating a physical representation of collective recollections, while investigating how a variety of people who differ in gender, age, race, neighborhood, and income all relate to the objects that populate their memories.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[I re-purpose the discarded.  Responding to the waste and urgency of contemporary times, i find value in re-working manufactured objects.  Re-working and \"repairing\" the industrial object by hand is the way I customize a generic and ubiquitous thing.  The restored object is an artifact of collaboration between the industry and the individual.  I expose the renovation of a once discarded object by highlighting functional and aesthetic hybridity.  I reveal the human hand in the work- always falling short of mechanized perfection.  These revamped objects are imbued with importance;  they reveal the value of the handmade, human labor of the individual.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[My work blocks obvious paths, illuminates the unused and unusual left over spaces and highlights hidden architectural elements in the installation space. I use color fields, graphical interjections of three-dimensional line drawings into viewers space to create new paths and unexpected barriers that enliven spaces previously taken for granted. Elements of interactivity are often dispersed throughout my work to challenge common notions of art. I also enjoy adding a bit of humor and absurdity so as to question the seriousness of the work.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The works of Joe Girandola attract our attention to minute details often overlooked in the corrupt rush of modern society.  Though classically trained as a stone carver in Italy, Girandola has veered away from the media concentrating on three-dimensional drawings completely made with Duct Tape.  Invented originally in Army green to weatherproof ammunition boxes, now, the DIY material has a veritable artists palette of color to choose from.  The stark portraits in varying colors of tape are prevalent in Girandola\'s work as he investigates a number of societal problems that are routinely covered up in our quick fix society.]]></BIO>

His work uncovers both who and what we look to for protection in contemporary society.

    <BIO><![CDATA[My work explores the ephemera surrounding various displays of identity.  I work with materials like tooled leather, sporty fabric, chunky silver, blocks of cork, and airbrushed paints.  Seen in the right context, these materials become signifiers of the cultural phenomena that have surrounded my own development:  the South, women\'s athletics, queer culture, hobbyists, and summer camp.  The aesthetics within these cultures reinforce embedded messages about gender, class, race, and sexuality.  I use earnest craftsmanship and humor to extract and subvert these messages, creating objects that move freely among social constructs and confront the contradictions therein.  -- Betsy Odom]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Working from a broad and deep knowledge of many different artistic disciplines with a printmaking core, Tate creates art that distorts and twists the expected relationships between pictures and text. All of his pieces, whether they are drawings, digital works, photography, or prints, have a visible influence from the graphic design of advertising, which makes their criticism of consumerism and politics all the more striking. He references current news and events in an effort to comment on American history, politics, and culture, utilizing satirical themes that encourage the viewer to reflect on contemporary society.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[The DIGITAL IKEBANA series is inspired by the ancient aesthetic discipline of the Ikebana floral arrangement.  However, my Ikebanas only exist as prints and digital images.  The series is comprised of a variety of images taken from online databases of university biology departments from all over the world.  They have been repurposed to investigate the relationship between artifice and nature.  I\'m inspired by the technique of layering digital media and the aspects of appropriation.  thus, I\'m exploring this idea while embracing the use of contemporary technologies like the internet.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Nathan Bennett is a New York-based artist who uses photography, video, sculpture and drawing in his multidisciplinary practice.  Bennett often integrates readymades and appropriated imagery in his work to present pieces of commercial culture with an uncanny tinge.  He is interested in philosophy, psychoanalysis and anthropology as social theory practices that confront the limitations of history and the production of culture.  In his work, Bennett hopes to create moments of desire and alienation that function as a magnifying glass for the irrationalities of capitalism.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[Using traditional tapestry techniques, I weave images of young women in states of undress or exposure, personal objects and landscapes relating to destruction and death.  My work is the culmination of research into addiction, sexual experimentation, popular internet culture, the effects of single parent households, socio-economic status\' etc.  

I am drawn to the images taken for private exchanges that become littered on the internet.  I am using my own images that I have sent to lovers as well as the objects that I have formed psychological attachments to, objects that have had impacts in other people\'s lives, displays of arrests, deaths, addictions. 

I am interested in the honesty of sexuality, but also how courtships, pornography and sex is changing as a result of the mass depiction of these intimate moments online.  I am inspired by the beauty of a woman to takes a self portrait for her own pleasure and the pleasure of the ones she cares about, and all the people who get to glimpse into that moment and what is done with the power of that intimacy.]]></BIO>

    <BIO><![CDATA[This project is an examination of dedication, culture, commitment, and the passion associated with the routines of \'Urban Surfers\'.  Sembrot said, \'I always knew some of my friends surfed but I never really knew what that meant. Being from Philadelphia, I knew people surfed at the Jersey Shore, which is pretty obvious if you hit the beach each summer.  But not knowing the culture and the passion that drives some individuals to wake up at 4am and driving a couple hours each way just to get a session in during a swell, I was basically clueless what surfing really meant to them.\']]></BIO>
